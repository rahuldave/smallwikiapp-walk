# Linting smallwikiapp, one move at a time

In watch mode, you read each move. The notes explain what it changed, and its commit holds the code. [The same tutorial in do mode](TUTORIAL-do.md).

This walk takes the moves about format and lint out of the whole tutorial of smallwikiapp. `wikiapp` is a small
command that prints the title and the summary of a random Wikipedia page. The walk starts with the project, which
`uv init` began, for Python 3.13. The command then gets its code. The moves about format and lint come after, and
check that code and its tests.

The project is a rebuild of [the original wikiapp](https://github.com/rahuldave/wikiapp), which its author wrote
in 2024 with pixi. Where the notes say "the original wikiapp", they mean that project.

The walk has ten stops. Each stop takes a whole step, one move, or a few moves in a row:

1. **The project** (step-00). What `uv init` made, and the command `wikiapp`. The justfile lists the tasks of the
   project.
2. **The command** (step-01). The command asks Wikipedia for a random page, and prints its title and summary. It
   sends a User-Agent, and has an option `--version`.
3. **A formatter** (step-04.1 to step-04.2). ruff comes in, and `just fmt` formats the code and the tests.
4. **The linter's rules** (step-04.3). The rules of the linter go in `pyproject.toml`, and `just lint` finds five
   problems.
5. **The linter's problems, fixed** (step-04.4 to step-04.6). ruff fixes the order of the imports. A person fixes
   the tests, and gives the request a timeout.
6. **A check of the configuration** (step-04.7). `just lint-config` checks `pyproject.toml`, the lockfile and the
   justfile.
7. **`just check`, every check in one recipe** (step-04.9). The format, the linter, the tests and the
   configuration, in order.
8. **A git hook** (step-04.10). pre-commit runs three small checks of the files, then `just check`, before each
   commit.
9. **The linter asks for types** (step-05.3 to step-05.5). A rule asks for a type on every parameter and return.
   The code and the tests get their types.
10. **The library's pyproject.toml too** (step-10.3). Since step 09, the library has a `pyproject.toml` of its own,
    and `just lint-config` checks it.

Each stop starts with `just setup`. From the second stop on, it starts from the code before its first move.

## Kinds of checks

The walk names each kind of check where it first comes in.

| Kind | What it does | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Formatter | Changes how the code looks, never what it does | Stop 3 |
| Linter | Finds problems in the code, against rules | Stop 4 |
| A fix by the tool | A fix that ruff counts as safe, such as the order of imports | Stop 5 |
| A fix by a person | The rest. ruff has no fix for some problems, and marks others unsafe | Stop 5 |
| A check of the configuration | Finds errors in `pyproject.toml`, the lockfile and the justfile | Stops 6 and 10 |
| A gate | `just check` runs every check, and a commit must pass it | Stop 7 |
| A hook | Runs the gate by itself, before each commit | Stop 8 |
| A linter's rule about types | Checks that each type is written. The type checker checks that it is right | Stop 9 |

From the move [step-06.4](https://rahuldave.com/smallwikiapp-walk/watch/step-06.html#step-06.4), GitHub runs `just check` too, on every push to main and
every pull request.

## What the walk leaves out

Between its stops, the whole tutorial makes moves that this walk does not show:

- **Before stop 3,** the steps [02](https://rahuldave.com/smallwikiapp-walk/watch/step-02.html) and [03](https://rahuldave.com/smallwikiapp-walk/watch/step-03.html). pytest
  comes in, in a dependency group `test`, which the group `dev` includes. Tests come in, with a mock in place of
  Wikipedia, and coverage on every run. The code splits into a library, `src/wikiapp/wikipedia.py`, and the
  command. The library takes a language and raises its own error,
  `WikipediaError`, and the command prints it as a message.
- **Before stop 7,** the move [step-04.8](https://rahuldave.com/smallwikiapp-walk/watch/step-04.html#step-04.8). The recipes refuse a lockfile that
  is out of date.
- **Before stop 9,** the first two moves of [step-05](https://rahuldave.com/smallwikiapp-walk/watch/step-05.html). ty, a type checker, comes in, and
  `just types` runs it. The command reads its version by the name of its package.
- **Before stop 10,** the last move of [step-05](https://rahuldave.com/smallwikiapp-walk/watch/step-05.html), the steps
  [06](https://rahuldave.com/smallwikiapp-walk/watch/step-06.html) to [09](https://rahuldave.com/smallwikiapp-walk/watch/step-09.html), and the first two moves of
  [step-10](https://rahuldave.com/smallwikiapp-walk/watch/step-10.html). `just check` runs the type checker too. The tests that ask the real
  Wikipedia run only on request, and GitHub runs the tests and `just check`. `random_page` returns a pydantic
  model, `Page`. smalldocs documents the code, and `just check` runs the check of the docs. The library becomes
  a package of its own, `packages/wikirandom`, with its own `pyproject.toml`. `just build` builds both
  packages, and the app asks for wikirandom 0.1.
- **After stop 10,** the last two moves of [step-10](https://rahuldave.com/smallwikiapp-walk/watch/step-10.html). The library gets a licence, both
  packages get a link to the repository, and the User-Agent says the installed version.

The [whole tutorial](https://rahuldave.com/smallwikiapp-walk/) has every step and every move.

## step-00 The project

[The code at step-00](https://github.com/rahuldave/smallwikiapp/tree/step-00)

```bash
just setup
```

The tutorial starts at step-00, so step-00 has no moves. `uv init --package --python 3.13 --name wikiapp` made
the shape of the project:

- `pyproject.toml`
- `src/wikiapp/__init__.py`, with a function `main`
- `.python-version`, with the Python version
- `README.md` and `.gitignore`

Then the author changed the project by hand. `main` moved to `src/wikiapp/console.py`. `pyproject.toml` got a
description, an author and a licence, and it names `wikiapp.console:main` as the command. `uv lock` wrote the
lockfile, `uv.lock`. The author also wrote the justfile and `LICENSE`, and wrote the README and `.gitignore` again, by hand.

`just setup` runs `uv sync --locked`. The command makes `.venv` with Python 3.13, from `.python-version`. It
installs exactly the packages that the lockfile names. Here, the only package is `wikiapp` itself.

```bash
cat pyproject.toml
```

The line under `[project.scripts]` makes `wikiapp` a command. The name is on the left. The function is on the
right, `main` in `src/wikiapp/console.py`. For now, `main` prints one line.

```bash
uv run wikiapp
cat src/wikiapp/console.py
```

The justfile is the interface of the project. `just` lists the tasks, and `just --show setup` shows the recipe
behind one task. `just help setup` shows the same recipe. Most steps add recipes to the justfile.

```bash
just
just --show setup
just --show help
just help setup
```

## step-01 The command

[The code at its Start](https://github.com/rahuldave/smallwikiapp/tree/ae86cb7d116c4103832edf25ab3a7a9077583830), the commit before step-01.1. [The code at step-01](https://github.com/rahuldave/smallwikiapp/tree/step-01) is the code after its moves.

```bash
just setup
```

The moves of step-01 add these things:

- the two packages that the command needs
- a request to Wikipedia for a page
- a header that Wikipedia now asks for
- the option `--version`

### step-01.1 click and requests

[The commit of this move](https://github.com/rahuldave/smallwikiapp/commit/1efd5611b90ac42a697374b0ca0449d5a880773e) shows what the move changes.

Now we add two packages, click and requests, to the dependencies of wikiapp. click makes command lines.
requests gets pages over HTTP.

The move ran: `uv add click requests`

Read the change of `pyproject.toml`.

The move changes these files:

- `pyproject.toml`: 4 lines added, 1 removed; the two packages in `dependencies`, each with the newest version as its lower bound.
- `uv.lock`: 176 lines added; the exact version of each, and of every package they need.

Files to read:
- [`pyproject.toml`](https://github.com/rahuldave/smallwikiapp/blob/1efd5611b90ac42a697374b0ca0449d5a880773e/pyproject.toml), [its change](https://github.com/rahuldave/smallwikiapp/commit/1efd5611b90ac42a697374b0ca0449d5a880773e#diff-50c86b7ed8ac2cf95bd48334961bf0530cdc77b5a56f852c5c61b89d735fd711): the dependencies of the package, which anyone who installs it gets.
  - look at: `"click>=8.5.0",`
- [`uv.lock`](https://github.com/rahuldave/smallwikiapp/blob/1efd5611b90ac42a697374b0ca0449d5a880773e/uv.lock): the exact versions, for every platform.

The change of `pyproject.toml`:

```diff

```

```bash
uv tree --depth 1
```

`uv tree` shows the two packages under `wikiapp`. A newer version of a package can come out after these notes.

### step-01.2 Ask Wikipedia for a page

[The commit of this move](https://github.com/rahuldave/smallwikiapp/commit/a46ba5420b43d7ea47508ae393977935e7bd8bd0) shows what the move changes.

Now we make `main` ask Wikipedia for a random page, and print it.

`src/wikiapp/console.py` now has a command, as in the first commit of the original wikiapp, from 2024. Its
docstring is new, and says what the command does. `@click.command()` makes `main` a command. The `main` of the original wikiapp had no `-> None`. The
`main` here keeps the annotation that `uv init` gave it at step-00.

- `requests.get` asks the REST API of Wikipedia for the summary of a random page.
- `raise_for_status` raises an exception if the answer is an error.
- `response.json()` reads the answer as a dictionary.

`main` prints the title in green, and the summary wrapped to 70 columns.

Read the change of `src/wikiapp/console.py`.

The move changes one file:

- `src/wikiapp/console.py`: 17 lines added, 2 removed; `main` asks Wikipedia for a page and prints it.

```

```bash
uv run wikiapp
```

The command fails. The last line of the traceback is `requests.exceptions.HTTPError: 403 Client Error:
Forbidden for url:` and the address. Wikipedia now refuses a request whose User-Agent header is the default of
a library. requests sends `python-requests/` and its version.

### step-01.3 A User-Agent

[The commit of this move](https://github.com/rahuldave/smallwikiapp/commit/2dd3e2132565971092bffe6a438a36506f4161cb) shows what the move changes.

Now we send a User-Agent header with the request. The User-Agent header says who sends the request. The policy of
Wikimedia asks for the name of the program, its version, and a way to reach the person who runs it. In
`src/wikiapp/console.py`, a constant `USER_AGENT` under `API_URL` gives these three things.

Find `USER_AGENT = "wikiapp/0.1.0 (https://github.com/rahuldave/smallwikiapp)"` in the change of
`src/wikiapp/console.py`.

The move changes one file:

- `src/wikiapp/console.py`: 2 lines added, 1 removed; a constant `USER_AGENT`, and the request sends it.

A title in green, and a paragraph. Each run prints another page.

### step-01.4 --version

[The commit of this move](https://github.com/rahuldave/smallwikiapp/commit/48a829ee985a69171af7c66846bdb8e7345a199c) shows what the move changes.

Now we let the command print its version. The package can read its own version from the installed package, which
has the version in `pyproject.toml`. `src/wikiapp/__init__.py` now sets `__version__` from the metadata of the
installed package. `src/wikiapp/console.py` imports `__version__`. The decorator `@click.version_option`, above
`def main`, gives the command the option `--version`.

Read the change of `src/wikiapp/__init__.py`, then the change of `src/wikiapp/console.py`.

The move changes these files:

- `src/wikiapp/__init__.py`: 2 lines added; `__version__`, from the installed package.

`--version` prints `wikiapp, version 0.1.0`. `--help` lists both options. click writes the help from the
decorators and the docstring. So the docstring of `main` is also help text, for a person who runs the command.

## step-04.1 to step-04.2 A formatter

[The code at its Start](https://github.com/rahuldave/smallwikiapp/tree/b090ad74622ee6109dd72ae66feec36377eef7d7), the commit before step-04.1.

```bash
just setup
```

### step-04.1 ruff, and the recipe fmt

[The commit of this move](https://github.com/rahuldave/smallwikiapp/commit/693240e344546dda08ad8fee3951675a0302dbc9) shows what the move changes.

Now we add ruff, a formatter and a linter in one program, to a third dependency group, `lint`, which `dev`
includes.

A formatter changes how the code looks, and never what it does. A linter finds problems in the code, such as a
variable that is never used. It changes nothing unless it is asked to.

The move ran: `uv add --group lint ruff`

Find `dev = [{ include-group = "test" }, { include-group = "lint" }]` in the change of `pyproject.toml`.

Next we give ruff its settings, at the end of `pyproject.toml`. They set lines of up to 100 characters, and
write out the defaults of the formatter.

Find `line-length = 100` in the change of `pyproject.toml`.

Then we add a recipe `fmt`, which runs the formatter. The words after `just fmt` go to `ruff format`.

Find `fmt *args:` in the change of `justfile`.

The move changes these files:

- `pyproject.toml`: 15 lines added, 1 removed; the group `lint`, and ruff's settings.
- `justfile`: 6 lines added; the recipe `fmt`.
- `uv.lock`: 31 lines added; ruff.

`--check` changes nothing. It lists the files that it would change, and fails. It prints `6 files would be

passes on the words after `just fmt`.

### step-04.2 The code, formatted

[The commit of this move](https://github.com/rahuldave/smallwikiapp/commit/ca8685e532e9d372857667484e1c94c91ac9e986) shows what the move changes.

Now we run the formatter, which rewrites six files. It adds blank lines, puts spaces around `==`, and splits the
lines longer than 100 characters.

The move ran: `just fmt`

Find `if __name__ == "__main__":` in the change of `src/wikiapp/console.py`. Then read the changes of
`src/wikiapp/wikipedia.py` and `tests/test_console.py`.

The move changes these files:

- `src/wikiapp/__init__.py`: 1 line added; a blank line after the import.
- `src/wikiapp/console.py`: 3 lines added, 1 removed; two blank lines before the command and before `if __name__`, and spaces around `==`.
- `src/wikiapp/wikipedia.py`: 5 lines added, 1 removed; two blank lines around the class, and the request, longer than 100 characters, split.
- `tests/conftest.py`: 1 line added; two blank lines before the fixture.
- `tests/test_console.py`: 11 lines added, 1 removed; two blank lines around each function, and the line longer than 100 characters split.
- `tests/test_wikipedia.py`: 1 line added; two blank lines before the test.

## step-04.3 The linter's rules

### step-04.3 The linter's rules, and the recipe lint

[The commit of this move](https://github.com/rahuldave/smallwikiapp/commit/c97fdb1e8e820db24fac697b01283c581924537e) shows what the move changes.

Now we choose the linter's rules, in a table at the end of `pyproject.toml`. The linter checks the code against
rules, and the table chooses the families of rules, one family on each line. The tests may use `assert`. The rest
of the code may not use it, because Python skips every `assert` when it runs with `-O`.

Find `select = [` and `"tests/**" = ["S101"]` in the change of `pyproject.toml`.

Next we add a recipe `lint`, which runs the linter. The words after `just lint` go to `ruff check`.

Find `lint *args:` in the change of `justfile`.

The move changes these files:

- `pyproject.toml`: 18 lines added; the rules.
- `justfile`: 6 lines added; the recipe `lint`.

The linter finds five problems, each with its code:

- `I001`: the imports of console.py are out of order.
- `E402`: an import in test_console.py comes below code.
- `F841`, twice: a variable is assigned and never used.
- `S113`: a request has no timeout.

`just lint` shows each problem with its lines. `uv run ruff rule S113` explains a code.

## step-04.4 to step-04.6 The linter's problems, fixed

[The code at its Start](https://github.com/rahuldave/smallwikiapp/tree/c97fdb1e8e820db24fac697b01283c581924537e), the commit before step-04.4.

```bash
just setup
```

### step-04.4 The linter sorts the imports

[The commit of this move](https://github.com/rahuldave/smallwikiapp/commit/ad0f0c3c814865fe7e54f5aaff74d55a831b2daf) shows what the move changes.

Now we let ruff fix the one problem of the five that it can fix safely. `just lint --fix` sorts the imports of
`console.py`. The command still ends with exit code 1, because four problems are left.

`--fix` makes only the fixes that ruff counts as safe, and the order of imports is one of them. ruff also has a
fix for the two unused variables. It marks that fix unsafe, because it may delete a comment on the line. It has no
fix for the other two problems. So a person decides about the other four.

The move ran: `just lint --fix`

Find `from wikiapp import __version__` in the change of `src/wikiapp/console.py`.

The move changes one file:

- `src/wikiapp/console.py`: 3 lines added, 2 removed; the imports in three blocks, which are the standard library, the packages
  installed, and then wikiapp's own.

Files to read:

`just lint --fix` reported `Found 5 errors (1 fixed, 4 remaining)` and failed. Four problems are left, and a
person must fix them.

### step-04.5 The tests' imports at the top, and no unused variables

[The commit of this move](https://github.com/rahuldave/smallwikiapp/commit/3ba5d239ff4f171c58d4249a33caafc510883b46) shows what the move changes.

Now we move `from wikiapp import console` up in `tests/test_console.py`, under `import requests`. A reader looks
for imports there. wikiapp's own imports are a block of their own, after the installed packages, as `--fix` made
them in console.py.

A person makes the fixes of this move. The linter names each problem and its lines, and the person decides how
to fix it. ruff has no fix for the import below the code, and its fix for the unused variables is unsafe.

Find `from wikiapp import console` in the change of `tests/test_console.py`.

Next we drop `result =` in `test_main_invokes_requests_get` and `test_main_uses_correct_url`, since no line reads
the result. The two tests check the mock, not the result.

Find `runner.invoke(console.main)` twice in the change of `tests/test_console.py`.

One problem is left, `S113`. The format is unchanged, and the check prints `7 files already formatted`.

### step-04.6 A timeout

[The commit of this move](https://github.com/rahuldave/smallwikiapp/commit/80c33d4cfaf4b157cd44482712e520c77378cf9c) shows what the move changes.

Now we give the request a timeout, because without one, requests waits as long as the server keeps the
connection open. So the command can wait for ever. The request in `src/wikiapp/wikipedia.py` now has `timeout=10`.

The linter asked for it, with the rule `S113`, from the family `S` of security rules. The linter found a problem
that no test had found. A person chose the number of seconds.

Find `API_URL.format(language=language), headers={"User-Agent": USER_AGENT}, timeout=10` in the change of
`src/wikiapp/wikipedia.py`.

If the server does not answer within 10 seconds, the request now raises an exception. `random_page` turns it
into a WikipediaError, as it does with every other error of requests.

The move changes one file:

- `src/wikiapp/wikipedia.py`: 1 line added, 1 removed; the timeout.

### step-04.7 The recipe lint-config

[The commit of this move](https://github.com/rahuldave/smallwikiapp/commit/4d3556f88a6f2241bd4b64b2e6e613d3d4d2534a) shows what the move changes.

Now we add validate-pyproject to the group `lint`, and a recipe `lint-config` that checks the configuration.
The recipe runs three commands. validate-pyproject checks `pyproject.toml` against the standard for it,
`uv lock --check` checks the lockfile, and `just --fmt --check --unstable` checks the `justfile`.

These commands check the configuration, not the code. An error in `pyproject.toml`, in the lockfile or in the
`justfile` can pass every test and the linter.

The move ran: `uv add --group lint validate-pyproject`

Find `"validate-pyproject>=0.26",` in the change of `pyproject.toml`. Then find `lint-config *args:` in the
change of `justfile`.

The move changes these files:

- `justfile`: 11 lines added; the recipe `lint-config`.
- `pyproject.toml`: 1 line added; validate-pyproject in the group `lint`.

[The code at its Start](https://github.com/rahuldave/smallwikiapp/tree/06ea9e2af2238f070b1e33f16aeb70002e25e44d), the commit before step-04.10.

```bash

```

### step-04.10 A git hook

[The commit of this move](https://github.com/rahuldave/smallwikiapp/commit/4834655a3e50dcf56c557463c29bfce592d6d3db) shows what the move changes.

Now we add pre-commit, which installs a git hook, to the group `lint`. A git hook is a program that git runs
before every commit. If the program fails, git refuses the commit.

`just check` is a gate that a person must remember to run. Once `just hook` installs the hook in a clone, the
hook runs it by itself, before each commit in that clone.

The move ran: `uv add --group lint pre-commit`

Find `"pre-commit>=4.6.2",` in the change of `pyproject.toml`.

Next we make `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, a new file that names the hooks. Three come from pre-commit's collection.
They check for valid YAML, large files and leftover merge-conflict markers. The last hook runs `just check`, so the
hook and the terminal run the same thing.

Open `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, a new file. Find `entry: just check` in it.

Then we add a recipe `hook`, after `setup` in the `justfile`, which installs the hook. It is a recipe of its own,
run once in each clone, because `just setup` runs at every step and never touches git.

Find `hook *args:` in the change of `justfile`.

The move changes these files:

- `.pre-commit-config.yaml`: 20 lines added; a new file, with the hooks.
- `justfile`: 5 lines added; the recipe `hook`, which installs the hook.
- `pyproject.toml`: 1 line added; pre-commit in the group `lint`.
- `uv.lock`: 138 lines added; the exact version of pre-commit, and of what it needs.

`uv run pre-commit install` prints `pre-commit installed at .git/hooks/pre-commit`, and `just hook` prints the
same line. The hook is in `.git/hooks`, and no step or move changes that folder. The hook stays installed for the
rest of the tutorial.

`pre-commit run` now runs every hook on the file named, as git will before a commit. The first time on a machine, it
prints `[INFO]` lines while it downloads the hooks. Then it prints four lines, each `Passed`.

With `--all-files`, pre-commit would check every file that git tracks. It would skip a new file until git tracks
it.

## step-05.3 to step-05.5 The linter asks for types

[The code at its Start](https://github.com/rahuldave/smallwikiapp/tree/2c744eaef504d1adcc7fba0938360d140ef49978), the commit before step-05.3.

```bash
just setup
```

### step-05.3 A type on every parameter and return

[The commit of this move](https://github.com/rahuldave/smallwikiapp/commit/50af6273ec0db467642d539935422d0f4fc50991) shows what the move changes.

Now we turn on ruff's `ANN` rules, with one line in the list `select` in `pyproject.toml`, after `"N"`. ty, the
type checker that `just types` runs, checks the types that the code states. The `ANN` rules make sure that the code
states a type for every parameter and return.

So the linter checks that a type is written, and the type checker checks that the type is right.

Find `"ANN", # annotations: every parameter and every return value has a type` in the change of
`pyproject.toml`.

The move changes one file:

- `pyproject.toml`: 1 line added; the rules `ANN`.

Files to read:

```bash

```

The linter finds 25 missing types, in the code and in the tests. They are 15 parameters (`ANN001`) and 10
returns (`ANN201`). `just check` fails at this move and at the next move, and passes again at step-05.5. So the
git hook would refuse a commit of this move or of the next.

### step-05.4 Types in the code

[The commit of this move](https://github.com/rahuldave/smallwikiapp/commit/48523b8748a8bd60f80b73e1b2b2322eb616325b) shows what the move changes.

Now we add the types to the code, in `src/wikiapp/wikipedia.py` and `src/wikiapp/console.py`.

In `src/wikiapp/wikipedia.py`, `random_page` takes a string. It returns the JSON that Wikipedia sends, which is
a dictionary from strings to values of any kind. `Any` says that ty cannot check the values. The file imports
`Any` at the top, above `import requests`. The standard library is a block of its own.

In `src/wikiapp/console.py`, `main` takes the language as a string. Its return type, None, was already there.

Find `def random_page(language: str = "en") -> dict[str, Any]:` in the change of `src/wikiapp/wikipedia.py`.
Then find `def main(language: str) -> None:` in the change of `src/wikiapp/console.py`.

The move changes these files:

- `src/wikiapp/wikipedia.py`: 3 lines added, 1 removed; the types of `random_page`.
- `src/wikiapp/console.py`: 1 line added, 1 removed; the type of `main`'s parameter.

The 22 problems that are left are all in the tests. They are 13 parameters and 9 returns.

### step-05.5 Types in the tests

[The commit of this move](https://github.com/rahuldave/smallwikiapp/commit/8f6e8938925501f9c1bc198818fbd8fab7b647ff) shows what the move changes.

Now we add the types to the tests, first to the fixture in `tests/conftest.py`. Since step-05.3, ruff's `ANN`
rules ask for a type on every parameter and return. The code has its types, and `just lint` finds 22 missing in
the tests.

The return type of a fixture is the type of what a test receives. The mock of `requests.get` is a `Mock`.
`mocker` is pytest-mock's `MockerFixture`, the name that replaced the original wikiapp's `MockFixture`.
`tests/conftest.py` now imports `Mock` and `MockerFixture`, and its fixture states both types.

Find `def mock_requests_get(mocker: MockerFixture) -> Mock:` in the change of `tests/conftest.py`.

Next we add the types to `tests/test_console.py` and `tests/test_wikipedia.py`. A test returns None.
`tests/test_console.py` imports `Mock` and `CliRunner` by name. The fixture `runner` returns `CliRunner()`, so its
return type is `CliRunner`. Every function has its types. `tests/test_wikipedia.py` imports `Mock` at the top, and
its test has its types.

Read the change of `tests/test_console.py`. Then find
`def test_random_page_uses_given_language(mock_requests_get: Mock) -> None:` in the change of
`tests/test_wikipedia.py`.

The move changes these files:

- `tests/conftest.py`: 4 lines added, 1 removed; the types of the fixture.
- `tests/test_console.py`: 11 lines added, 9 removed; the types of the fixture and of every test.

### step-10.3 lint-config checks both pyproject.toml files

[The commit of this move](https://github.com/rahuldave/smallwikiapp/commit/6bcee949820224c622cb47680d467acacef15ae9) shows what the move changes.

Now we make `just lint-config` check the library's `pyproject.toml` too.
Since step 09, the repository has two `pyproject.toml` files, and `just lint-config` checks only the app's. The
recipe `lint-config` now gives validate-pyproject both files.

Read the change of `justfile`.

The move changes one file:

- `justfile`: 1 line added, 1 removed; `lint-config` checks both files.
